# sthlm.clj meetup - 2018-01-17

This is code done for the sthlm.clj meetup in order to have some
Clojerl code to run and share.

## Running

First thing you need is to build Clojerl following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/clojerl/clojerl#building). Once built
you will be able to start a REPL by using the `bin/clje` or
`bin/clojerl` scripts in the `clojerl` repository. For better/faster
accesss you can always add this `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

Running the code on any of the files in the `src/meetup` directory
is as easy as:

    $ path/to/clojerl/bin/clje src/meetup/core.cljc

If you have the `clj` and `clojure` scripts from Clojure installed,
all `.cljc` files can also be run with Clojure as well.

    $ clj src/meetup/core.cljc
